- **Comprehensive logging** and error handling

### ⚒️ Work Service
- **Work submission processing** with nonce validation
- **Parallel batch execution** for multiple submissions
- **Reward calculation** with multipliers and bonuses
- **Transaction management** with proper error recording
- **Performance optimization** with timeouts and limits

### 🌾 Harvest Service
- **Harvest eligibility determination** based on work history
- **Reward calculation** per farmer work contributions
- **Balance updates** after successful harvests
- **Batch processing** with error recovery
- **Service health monitoring**

### 🌐 REST API Server
- **Fastify-based REST API** with proper TypeScript typing
- **Complete endpoint implementation**:
  - `POST /farmers/register` - Farmer registration with custodial wallets
  - `POST /plant` - Coordinated plant operations
  - `POST /work` - Work submission processing
  - `POST /harvest` - Harvest reward distribution
  - `GET /health` - Service health monitoring
  - `GET /info` - Service information and configuration
- **Request/response logging** and error handling
- **Input validation** and proper HTTP status codes
- **Comprehensive error responses**

## 🎯 Phase 1 Compliance

### ✅ All Phase 1 Requirements Met:
1. **Custodial wallet management** - Complete with Stellar SDK
2. **Plant/Work/Harvest coordination** - All operations implemented
3. **REST API endpoints** - All specified endpoints working
4. **Database event sourcing** - Immutable audit trail
5. **Batch processing** - Configurable parallel execution
6. **Error handling** - Comprehensive logging and recovery
