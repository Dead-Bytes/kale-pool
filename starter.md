# KALE Pool Mining - Implementation Starter

## Overview
Building a pooled KALE mining system where poolers coordinate work for multiple farmers through custodial wallets, following Phase 1 specifications.

## Key Components
- **Backend Service**: REST API with custodial wallet management (plant/work/harvest endpoints)
- **Pooler Service**: Block monitoring, work coordination, harvest automation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with immutable event tables for audit trail
- **Integration**: Uses existing KALE smart contracts and proven miner implementations

## Architecture Approach
- **Parallel Processing**: Plant and harvest operations run concurrently for 50+ farmers
- **Custodial Wallets**: Manual funding by users, unencrypted keys for Phase 1
- **Event Sourcing**: Immutable plantings/works/harvests tables prevent race conditions
- **Clear Separation**: Pooler handles mining logic, Backend handles wallet operations

## Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Bun for both Backend and Pooler services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Blockchain**: Stellar network with KALE smart contract integration
- **Mining**: Integration with existing kale-miner C++/GPU implementation

## Implementation Philosophy
Following VibeSafe tenets: documentation-first, user autonomy, shared landmarks, and human-AI collaboration through structured workflow.

## Next Steps
1. Create documentation structure per VibeSafe methodology
2. Implement project structure (Backend/, Pooler/, Shared/)
3. Build core database schema and API endpoints
4. Integrate mining capabilities and end-to-end testing

**Status**: Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation
**Timeline**: 15 working days for complete integration
