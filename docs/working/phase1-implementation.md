# Phase 1 KALE Pool Mining Implementation

## Status: In Progress
**Started**: 2025-01-25
**Estimated Completion**: Phase 1 complete in 15 working days

## Objective
Build a working pooled KALE mining system where poolers coordinate work for multiple farmers through custodial wallets.

## Current Task
Setting up project structure and core database schema following phase1.md specifications.

## Key Design Decisions Made
1. **Project Structure**: Backend/, Pooler/, Shared/ directories as specified
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL with immutable event tables (plantings, works, harvests)
3. **Runtime**: Bun for both services for performance and modern TypeScript
4. **Wallet Strategy**: Custodial wallets with manual funding, unencrypted keys for Phase 1

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Read and understand CIP/AI-requirements framework
- [x] Analyze KALE smart contract and kale-miner implementations  
- [x] Create documentation structure
- [x] Setup project structure directories (Backend/, Pooler/, Shared/)
- [x] Create shared types (common.ts, blockchain.ts)
- [x] Create shared utilities (constants.ts, helpers.ts)
- [x] Implement database schema (schema.sql, initial migration)
- [x] Create Backend package.json and TypeScript configuration
- [x] Create Backend environment configurations (.env.mainnet, .env.testnet)
- [x] Create Backend API types and interfaces
- [x] Implement Backend database service with query classes
- [ ] Create Stellar wallet management service
- [ ] Create Backend API server with Fastify
- [ ] Implement plant/work/harvest API endpoints
- [ ] Create Pooler service package and configuration
- [ ] Implement Pooler block monitor service
- [ ] Build plant coordination system
- [ ] Integrate work manager
- [ ] Implement harvest controller
- [ ] End-to-end testing

## Next Steps
1. Create Backend/, Pooler/, Shared/ directory structure
2. Implement PostgreSQL database schema from phase1.md
3. Setup Bun project configurations and dependencies

## Issues Encountered
None yet.

## Design Validations Needed
- Database schema review for race condition prevention
- API endpoint structure validation
- Error attribution system verification
