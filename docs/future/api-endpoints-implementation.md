# KALE Pool Mining System - Complete API Endpoints Implementation Plan

## Analysis Summary

### Current State
- ✅ Backend Express server running on port 3000
- ✅ Complete PostgreSQL database schema with all required tables
- ✅ Basic farmer registration and pooler coordination working
- ✅ Fastify with basic CORS and middleware setup
- ✅ Existing services: plant, work, harvest, wallet management
- ✅ Database includes: users, farmers, poolers, pool_contracts, plantings, works, harvests, etc.

### Required Implementation
Based on the SRS document, we need to implement comprehensive API endpoints for:

1. **Authentication & Authorization System**
   - JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
   - Support for admin, pooler, and farmer roles
   - Token refresh and session management

2. **Pooler Discovery & Management** 
   - Public pooler discovery (no auth required)
   - Detailed pooler information and performance metrics
   - Pooler dashboard and management endpoints

3. **Contract Management**
   - Contract discovery and filtering
   - Active contract management
   - Contract lifecycle tracking

4. **Farmer Analytics**
   - Plant/harvest history with pagination
   - Reward tracking and summaries
   - Performance dashboards

5. **Pooler Analytics**
   - Work history and performance metrics
   - Reward distribution tracking
   - Management dashboard

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Authentication & Authorization Infrastructure
- Install JWT dependencies (jsonwebtoken, bcrypt)
- Create user authentication tables if needed (extend existing users table)
- Implement JWT middleware and role-based access control
- Create auth endpoints (/auth/login, /auth/register, /auth/me, etc.)

### Phase 2: Database Optimization
- Add required indexes as specified in SRS
- Create optimized queries for analytics endpoints
- Implement pagination helpers
- Add performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Core API Endpoints
- Implement pooler discovery endpoints
- Create contract management endpoints  
- Build farmer analytics endpoints
- Develop pooler analytics endpoints

### Phase 4: Middleware & Security
- Add rate limiting middleware
- Implement input validation
- Add request/response logging
- Security headers and CORS configuration

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
- Test all endpoints with different role permissions
- Validate pagination and filtering
- Performance testing with large datasets
- API documentation generation

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies to Add
```json
{
  "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
  "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3", 
  "@types/jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.3",
  "@types/bcryptjs": "^2.4.4"
}
```

### Database Indexes Required (from SRS)
- Pool contracts: pooler_id, farmer_id, status
- Plantings: farmer_id, pooler_id, block_index, timestamp
- Harvests: farmer_id, pooler_id, block_index, timestamp  
- Works: farmer_id, pooler_id, block_index, timestamp
- Performance optimization indexes

## Next Steps

1. Start with authentication infrastructure since it's foundational
2. Add required database indexes for performance 
3. Implement core endpoints following SRS specifications
4. Add comprehensive middleware stack
5. Test and validate all functionality

## Risk Mitigation

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing endpoints
- Use feature flags to gradually roll out new functionality
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Test thoroughly before deploying

## Success Criteria

- All SRS endpoints implemented and functional
- Role-based access control working correctly
- Pagination and filtering working with large datasets
- Response times under 2 seconds as specified
- Comprehensive error handling and security measures
- Full backward compatibility with existing functionality
